SAFETY INFORMATION
-----------------
⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY WARNINGS ⚠️
1. Maximum Safe Climber Weight: 153.6 kg
2. Overall Safety Factor: 7.5 (3.0 × 2.5 for dynamic loads)
3. Minimum Required Materials:
   - 18mm structural grade plywood
   - Grade 8.8 or higher M10 bolts
   - Structural grade timber
4. Required Anchor Points: Minimum 4
5. Load Testing:
   - Test with static loads before climbing
   - Start at 50% max weight and gradually increase
   - Check all joints and anchors after testing
6. Regular Inspection:
   - Check all bolts monthly
   - Inspect timber for damage/rot
   - Verify anchor points remain secure
7. Additional Safety Measures:
   - Use proper crash pads
   - Never climb alone
   - Stay within weight limits
   - Maintain proper clearance zones

CERTIFIED INSPECTION REQUIRED:
This design must be reviewed by a qualified person
before use. Climbing is inherently dangerous and
improper construction could result in serious
injury or death.

ADDITIONAL MATERIALS
-------------------
- Weather sealant for plywood
- Construction screws (minimum 4 per joint)
- Washers for all bolts
- Anti-slip matting for ground protection

INSTALLATION NOTES
-----------------
1. All timber should be structural grade
2. Use galvanized/weather-resistant hardware if outdoor installation
3. Pre-drill all screw holes to prevent splitting
4. Check all angles before final assembly
5. Ensure proper anchoring to ground/wall
6. Apply sealant before installing holds
7. Double-check all bolt tightness before use
